The details can vary. I chose to only include the methods in `Foundations` because that is the focus of the diagram. My modeling of the enumerated type is also a bit unorthodox in that I put in the field values (which should be underlined to show they are static, but that is not supported by JetUML, and the information can be inferred from the `enum` stereotype). I also named the association to `CardStack`, but left the association between `CardStack` and `Card` anonymous because, again, the focus was on the design of `Foundations`.
