# Clarifications and Corrections for Chapter 9

* On page 238 method `compareByRank` would be best declared `public` so it can be usable outside the class.
* On page 249 there are two extra parentheses in the first sorting code fragment. See the corrected version as method `sampleSortingApplication1` in [Card.java](../chapter-code/chapter9/Card.java).
* On page 255, the sequence diagram shows two function objects as key extractors (`f1` and `f2`). However, there is only a single key extractor object involved in this scenario.
