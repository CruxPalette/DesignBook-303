# Clarifications and Corrections for Chapter 9

* Page 238: method `compareByRank` would be best declared `public` so it can be usable outside the class.
* Page 249: there are two extra parentheses in the first sorting code fragment. See the corrected version as method `sampleSortingApplication1` in [Card.java](../chapter-code/chapter9/Card.java).
* Page 255: in the second code fragment, `comparator.comparing..`. should be `Comparator.comparing...`.
* Page 255: the sequence diagram shows two function objects as key extractors (`f1` and `f2`). However, there is only a single key extractor object involved in this scenario.
